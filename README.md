# Ecommerce_decision_prediction


#### Description

This was my third project for the METIS data science bootcamp.

In this project, I assumed the role of a marketing data scientist for an ecommerce company.  With the goal of increasing website conversions, I examined user interaction with the website and then made a prediction on whether the user was likely to make a purchase or not.  From here I made recommendations based on the prediction to increase conversion rate.  

Logistic regression was used to make the predictions.
